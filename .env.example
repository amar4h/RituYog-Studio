# Storage Configuration
# The app supports two storage modes:
# - localStorage (default): Data stored in browser, good for development
# - api: Uses PHP/MySQL backend via API calls for production

# For development (localStorage mode - default)
# No configuration needed, data persists in browser

# For production (API mode)
# VITE_STORAGE_MODE=api
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-domain.com/api
# VITE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
